# Hexagon Animation

An interactive canvas animation featuring hexagons that create beautiful ripple effects across the screen.

## Features

## Animation Details

### Ripple Behavior

- Interval-based ripples maintain a minimum distance of 3 hexagons between groups
- Each ripple can have 3-4 waves for wider spread
- Maximum 6 hexagons per wave in each ripple
- Staggered appearance and disappearance for more natural effect

### Animation Speeds
- Slow appearance animation (0.01-0.02 range)
- Slow hide animation (0.01 speed, approximately 1 second transition)
- Faster hover animation show (0.1 for appearance)
- Faster hover animation hide (0.05 for disappearance)

### Hexagon Design
- White borders with transparent fill
- CSS clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 25%, 100% 75%, 50% 100%, 0% 75%, 0% 25%)
- 4px Ã— 2px margins between hexagons
